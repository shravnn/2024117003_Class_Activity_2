ERRORS CORRECTED : 

1) The function definition is missing a colon

2) targ is used but the parameter is named target

3) *** is used instead of **

4) ranges() is used instead of range()

5) The variable sol is used but it should be solutions

6) There's a comma after the function call which shouldn't be there

7) The target number in the print statement is 1728 while the function call uses 1729

8) The print statement shows a**2 + b**2 but should show a**3 + b**3

9) printf() is used instead of print() as in python its print() not printf()
